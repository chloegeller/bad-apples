    <span style="font-size:18px;"><strong><em>Informed consent:</em></strong><br>
      <span style="color:#222222;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You are being asked to participate in a project being conducted by a research team at Harvard University, under the direction of Dr.
        Tomer Ullman. We are interested in how people are able to reason quickly and in a commonsense way about the different objects and people they encounter in the world around them. A better
        understanding of commonsense reasoning has implications for building more intelligent machines that can reason in a more human-like way, lowering risk in different physical situations. During
        this study, you will be presented with verbal events. To assess your understanding of these displays, you will be asked questions and you will respond by selecting an appropriate
        response.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All information collected from the study will be associated with&nbsp;a randomly generated Prolific code number or&nbsp;Prolific ID,&nbsp;which is the only
        identifying data you will be requested to provide. Unless your profile is set to private, Prolific IDâ€™s can be used to link back to user accounts. We suggest you set your profile
        to&nbsp;private. This ID will be changed to Study IDs upon payment. Only researchers associated with this project will have access to the data. In order to make our research transparent to the
        scientific and broader community our study design and unidentifiable data are made publicly available on Open Science Framework, a network of research materials and collaboration software, but
        your data will not be in anyway identifiable.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We will also provide you with a demographic questionnaire. The form does not include any personal identifying information other than your Prolific ID. Your
        contribution to this questionnaire is voluntary; if you choose to provide the requested information, your responses will be confidential. You will be reimbursed at a rate of [$10/hr] for your
        participation. You might be requested to provide your Prolific ID for reimbursement purposes, but these numbers will be deleted immediately after reimbursement.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Your participation in our study would be greatly appreciated. If you have any questions about the project please feel free to contact us at the Lab for Computation,
        Cognition, and Development at the Department of Psychology, 33 Kirkland Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, or via email at&nbsp;</span><a target="_parent"
