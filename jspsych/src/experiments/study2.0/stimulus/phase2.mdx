<Card.Body>

    Suppose there’s a <span className="new">**NEW {props.subcategory}**</span> called “**_{props.probe}_**”.

    You have <span className="color-red">**not**</span> {props.past_tense} this yet.

    Your friends have {props.past_tense} this {props.subcategory}, and they rate it
    <span className="new">**3 out of 10**</span> (on a scale where 10 is the most preferable, and 1 is the least
    preferable).

    Your friends know you well. They think that if you try it, you will also rate it a 3 out of 10.
