    ## In this study, we are interested in how people choose to spend their time.

    ### This study has 12 rounds.

    <div className="py-2 w-100" />

    For each round, you will be asked to give an example of a <span className="familiar">**FAMILIAR**</span> item or
    experience that you find very enjoyable (<span className="familiar">**9 out of 10**</span>, where 10 is the most
    preferable, and 1 is the least preferable).

    You will then be told of a <span className="new">**NEW**</span> thing or experience in the same category, that is
    rated lower (<span className="new">**3 out of 10**</span>, where 10 is the most preferable, and 1 is the least
    preferable).

    <div className="py-2 w-100" />

    **YOUR TASK**: For each **<span className="familiar">FAMILIAR</span>/<span className="new">NEW</span>** pair of
    items or experiences, please enter your best estimate of how you would like to split your time between them.
