## In this study, we are interested in how people choose to spend their time.

### This study has 12 rounds.

<div className="py-2 w-100"/>

For each round, you will be asked to give an example of a <span className="familiar">**FAMILIAR**</span> item or
experience that you find very enjoyable (<span className="familiar">**9 out of 10**</span>, where 10 is the most
preferable, and 1 is the least preferable).

You will then be told of a <span className="new">**NEW**</span> thing or experience in the same category, that is
rated lower (<span className="new">**3 out of 10**</span>, where 10 is the most preferable, and 1 is the least
preferable).

<div className="py-2 w-100"/>

<Alert kind="info">**YOUR TASK**: For each **<span
    className="familiar">FAMILIAR</span>/<span className="new">NEW</span>** pair
    of
